Exploration of Outdoor Air Quality in
Minnesota

A series of interactive slides which let's you explore Minnesota’s Air Quality
Index from various viewpoints. The exploration demonstrates the impact of
various events (COVID shutdowns, July 4th Fireworks, Wildfires) on the
outdoor air quality in Minnesota as measured by the air quality index.


## Messaging
## ViewPoint - MN Air Quality during COVID-19 Lockdowns
It has been observed that during COVID-19 lockdowns there was an impact
on air quality through out the world. It was noticed that the average AQI
was lower, indicating good air quality. The visualizations use data reported
by various air quality stations in Minnesota and point out important
observations, such as COVID lockdowns, air quality during July 4th, and
George Floyd riots and protests.

## Viewpoint - MN Air Quality During July 4th Holiday
July 4 Fireworks create unhealthy levels of air pollution. During the Fourth
of July in the daytime, concentrations of PM2.5 can rise anywhere between
10 micrograms per cubic meter--well below the EPA 24-hour standard of
35. However, near sunset on July 4, the PM2.5 levels spiked up to 35, and
continue to rise during the early morning hours to 59, an air quality level
that is considered “Unhealthy”. According to the EPA, if sustained for 24
hours, this “red zone” air quality will cause increased aggravation of heart
or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary
disease, and the elderly, and will also cause increased respiratory effects in
the general population.


## Viewpoint - MN Air Quality During Canadian Wildfires
Observing data from Jun 2021 to end of July 2021. July 20th, 2021, Air
quality alert was expanded across Minnesota over Canadian wildfire
smoke. Heavy smoke from Canadian wildfires prompted the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency to expand an air quality alert originally for
northern Minnesota to much of the state.

## Viewpoint - MN Air Quality throughout the years
The data presented here allows one to observe the data freely. The data
was downloaded from United States Environmental Protection Agency.

## Narrative Structure
The visualization uses an Interactive Slideshow structure and allows the user
to hover over the time series data to observe the data values.
Visual Structure: Line graphs, annotation and tooltips are used to help user
interact and view the data. A consistent visual structure is used across the
scenes, framing the viewpoints and keep the air quality as the main focus
throughout the slides.

## Scenes 
The scenes start off the observing the air quality during covid and interesting
insights and observations are pointed out to the user via annotations, tooltips
and text. The scenes take a viewpoint approach by pivoting and looking at
the data from various pivot or viewpoints.

## Annotations 
The visualizations use minimal and clean style annotation and point out
events to call out and any spikes in the data.

## Parameters 
The visualizations are updated and changed based on the data station
chosen by the user. The station represents various areas from suburbs to
wilderness areas of Minnesota. 

## Triggers 
The change of air quality data station is the trigger to update the line graphs.
Another trigger is when the user hovers over the line graphs the tooltips are
shown with the air quality index and the data of the observation.
